Go project to visualize sort and pathfinding algorithms.

* Uses ebengine for graphics.
* Supports play/pause feature in the middle of visualization.
* Leveraged async as much as possible.

Below shows mutltithreaded quicksort in action. (Ideally nobody does this kind of sort but helped me learn a lot about channels and pubsun architecture in general)
